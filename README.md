Student dropouts are a problem for higher education institution. They damage the schools reputation, reduce income, and waste money and other resources. It’s important to identify potential dropouts early so that preventative measures can be taken.

Using data from Portuguese university students, I’ve built a logistic regression model to predict dropouts with 87% accuracy and a well-generalized fit. I discuss my process and share results in this article.

The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains demographic and academic information in addition to general economic measures. It can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
